            As my main programming language, I started working with it in my final year of my bachelor studies. Since
            then, I used it in most of the projects that I did during my journey from an undergrad student up until now.
            Doing so, I gained about 3 years of experience programming C++. I'm fascinated how it can be used to do very
            efficient and hardware related things and at the same time it is very good in abstracting things away. To
            improve my skills further, I did two online courses. One of them was the <a

              Nanodegree</a>. Currently I mainly use C++17 in my role as a software engineer in the context of
            telecommunication technology. Doing that, I really like to program multi threaded applications and do proper
            memory management while I'm working on the networking protocol layer. It is also a common task for me to
            read RFCs or other standardization manifestos and translate them to C++ code.

            Python is the programming language that I favour if C++ is not appropriate to the task that I want to
            accomplish. I gained my first experiences during my bachelors thesis, where I used it to program a deep
            learning model to do semantic labeling on images. Since then, I used it to do data analysis and data
            visualization or to automate things that would be done by hand otherwise. During my time as a PhD student, I
            programmed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank"
              class="text-decoration-none">REST</a> service with it using <a

            machine learning model to do object detection on images. In my current role as a software engineer, I use
            python for most of the things that are not required to be optimized for runtime or memory usage, especially
            for backend web services. My favourite package manager is <a
              href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution" target="_blank"
              class="text-decoration-none">anaconda</a>, since it did a lot of machine learning in the past, but if that
            is not appropriate, I commonly use a virtual environment and install my packages with pip.

            Linux is my favourite operating system since the end of my bachelors studies. For me, it is very convenient
            to have full (sudo) control over the OS and I really like to be in the terminal all day. My experience
            starts by building projects, goes over system configuration e.g. with systemd and updating configuration
            files of applications or configuring FTP servers. Logging into remote machines via ssh is also part of my
            daily business and goes up until creating debian packages for applications to make my code usable for other
            users that are not developers. Doing some hobby projects with the rasperry pi and beaglebone black, I 
            recently started learning about the deeper linux internals like how to load, unload and write linux device 
            drivers and how to build my own custom linux using buildroot or Yocto.

            Docker is a very powerful containerization tool to make your applications run on every system that has the

            machine"-problem. I started using it during my PhD time and currently using it on a daily basis in
            combination with docker-compose to create software projects with multiple components. It's a common task for
            me to create Dockerfiles, build containers and run images as a standalone system or within a compose
            project. I'm also able to configure more complicated things within docker based projects or to talk to the
            docker API from my code.

            Kafka is a middleware which is used in distributed big data systems. Based on a publisher-subscriber system,

            the pure functionallity, there are some convenience tools like kafkacat (former the terminal interface kcat)
            and support for a lot of programming languages. I program consumers as well as producers with C++ and I'm
            also able to configure the kafka-broker and the zookeeper to fit system-requirements.

            abstracts the communication layer between different services away such that the developer can concentrate on
            the algorithmic part. Commonly, the execution of algorithms that are encapsulated within so called "nodes"
            are message based, since ROS incooperates the publisher-subscriber pattern. Besides that, ROS delivers a lot
            of convenient tools for visualization (Rviz) and a huge amount of libraries that implement common robotics
            algorithms as well as some drivers for hardware interaction. I used it during my time as a working student
            at the Forschungszentrum Informatik and during my time as a PhD student there, automating an autonomous
